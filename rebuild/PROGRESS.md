# Jarvis rebuild (agent-1) — PROGRESS

**All 7 phases built and tested** (Phases 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7 complete; Phase 4 confirmation/shadow/
receipts core complete — that is the whole of Phase 4's code scope).

**Exact next step:** production persistence + runtime wiring (the deploy-side work, not new
features): replace the in-memory repositories with D1-backed adapters that run
`migrations/0001_init.sql`; persist Durable Object state across evictions; bind Vectorize +
Workers AI + R2 in place of the in-memory/fake stand-ins; and implement the DO WebSocket loop that
streams ConversationRelay call turns. The agent core already treats a voice turn identically to a
text turn, so that last one is transport wiring, not logic.

**Voice runtime note:** the `/voice` webhook (Twilio signature verified, returns ConversationRelay
TwiML) and the caller-id/PIN/guest logic are built and unit-tested. The DO WebSocket loop that
streams call turns is the one piece not wired end-to-end in the sandbox (no Twilio).

## How to run the tests

```powershell
cd rebuild
npm install
npm test
```

59 tests pass (`vitest`). `npm run typecheck` (`tsc --noEmit`) is clean.

## What is built (file → one line)

- `src/clock.ts` — injected Clock (SystemClock + FixedClock); no direct Date.now (trap #4).

- `src/model/types.ts` — Model interface; MissingModelKeyError (no keyword fallback exists).
- `src/model/deepseek.ts` — real DeepSeek adapter; fetch bound to globalThis (trap #1); throws if no key.
- `src/model/fake-model.ts` — scripted model for tests (plays a queue; never reads words).
- `src/memory/facts-repo.ts` — facts ledger; corrections version (never overwrite); forget = hide.
- `src/memory/embeddings.ts` — EmbeddingProvider (Workers AI real + deterministic fake) + VectorIndex.
- `src/memory/provenance.ts` — verifies a 'stated' fact's quote appears in Sid's message.
- `src/memory/memory-tools.ts` — memory_save/correct/forget/restore/confirm/pin/unpin/explain/search + history_search.

## Tests (all fail if the behaviour breaks)

- `test/phase1-nervous-system.test.ts` (7): reply + stored conversation; history reaches the model;
  time/tz injected; every tool call logged; empty reply surfaced+logged; model error surfaced+logged;
  failed send surfaced honestly.
- `test/phase2-memory.test.ts` (8): provenance quote pass/fail; temporary needs expires_at (no default);
  meaning search drops hidden/expired; temporary expiry; corrections version+link; pinned facts injected;
  one store serves text+voice.
- `test/webhook.test.ts` (8): fail closed (no secret / no owner); wrong secret 401; non-owner not processed;
  owner accepted; forwarded/private/group provenance; inline-tap callback classified.
- `test/phase4-confirmations.test.ts` (7): confirmable held as pending (not executed); no same-turn
  self-confirm; executes only after a later confirm and is honestly `not_connected`; args-hash binding;
  shadow logs would-have; TTL expiry; receipts_query proof.
- `test/phase3-connected-apps.test.ts` (6): one message connects an app (confirmed) and loads its tools;
  an app tool works on text AND voice; an app's confirmable tool routes through Jarvis's gate; an app
  event wakes Jarvis which decides whether to tell Sid; a down app returns an honest error; a fact from
  an app event is stored with the app as its source.
- `test/phase5-calling.test.ts` (10): a call uses the same tools/memory as text; prompt says CHANNEL:voice;
  a sensitive action refuses without a verified PIN; proceeds (honestly not_connected) with a correct PIN;
  wrong/missing PIN fails closed; caller-id classifies owner/guest/unknown (and fail-closed with no owner
  phone); a guest gets a minimal prompt with no owner facts/memory/tools and no shared-history write;
  Connect TwiML built; Twilio signature verified (fail-closed); hashed PIN is not plaintext.
- `test/phase6-daily-rhythm.test.ts` (6): schedule_wakeup validates + alarm; alarm tracks the earliest;
  fires only PASSED wake-ups (asserts which firing); Eastern DST wall-clock (EST + EDT); hourly cron fires
  due wake-ups, hands Jarvis an hourly check, pings watchdog, beats, and the MODEL chooses to send a digest;
  nightly cron runs only the backup.
- `test/phase7-plumbing.test.ts` (7): backup exports every table + every row (100, not capped); archive by
  date + search across range incl call transcripts; archive_search tool; heartbeat alive-vs-quiet; watchdog
  honest not_connected vs a real ping; vault export processes EVERY note (101, not 64); vault token fail-closed.

## Mutation checks done this session (trap: don't trust green until you mutate)

Each guard below was broken on purpose; the named test went red; then reverted. See the
"Mutation sweep" section at the bottom of this file for the exact edits and results.

- Provenance substring check → phase2 "refuses a stated fact whose quote is NOT in..." went red.
- Webhook fail-closed (no secret) → webhook "fails closed when the webhook secret..." went red.
- Same-turn self-confirm guard → phase4 "refuses to self-confirm within the same turn" went red.
- Confirmation gate (ran the action on first call) → phase4 "holds a confirmable action as pending" went red.
- Temporary-expiry in FactsRepo.isActive → phase2 "temporary facts drop out of recall" went red.
- App-tool confirmable propagation (forced false) → phase3 "routes through Jarvis's enforced confirmation" went red.
- App failure visibility (fake pretend-success) → phase3 "failure is visible: a down app..." went red.
- Voice PIN enforcement in the gate (disabled) → phase5 "a sensitive action on a call REFUSES without a verified PIN" went red.
- Guest branch in agent core (removed) → phase5 "a guest call gets a minimal prompt..." went red.
- Wake-up due-time check (fire everything) → phase6 "fires only wake-ups whose time has PASSED" went red.
- Vault export capped at 64 (the old bug) → phase7 "processes EVERY note" went red.
- Vault token fail-open (no token => allow) → phase7 "token-gated and fails closed" went red.

## Decisions not in the brief (mine, flagged for Sid)

1. **Branch name.** The task asked for `rebuild/agent-1`, but this Arena session is hard-fixed to
   the branch `arena/01a0ded1-jarvis` (the platform tracks the session by it; work on any other
   branch is lost). I kept the ISOLATION intent exactly — every change is under `rebuild/`, nothing
   outside is touched — but on this session branch, and the draft PR is opened from it. If you want
   the literal `rebuild/agent-1` branch, say so and a maintainer can `git branch rebuild/agent-1`
   off this one; the diff is identical.
2. **Confirmation "yes" path.** A typed YES is interpreted by the MODEL, which then calls
   `confirm_action(pending_id)`; code only checks the pending action exists, is Sid's, is unexpired,
   and was not created in the same turn. A Telegram inline TAP is a structured callback the code can
   act on directly (strongest path). Code never reads the word "yes".
3. **Confirmation summary.** Each confirmable tool accepts an optional `confirmation_summary` the
   model writes; if omitted, the gate builds a factual `tool(args)` description (a receipt, not a
   judgment).
4. **connect_app is confirmable.** Section 3 says only the five actions ask for confirmation, but
   Phase 3 says connecting an app is "a one-time setup step with a confirmation." I honored Phase 3:
   `connect_app` routes through the same enforced gate, because granting an app a place in the tool
   catalogue is a permission change. Flagged here so it isn't read as a sixth everyday confirmation.

## What is faked, and why

- **DeepSeek model** — no API key in the sandbox. Tests use a *scripted* FakeModel that plays a queue
  of responses; it never reads Sid's words with keywords. The real `DeepSeekModel` is written and
  type-checked but not run here. No keyword fallback exists: with no key, construction throws.
- **Embeddings / Vectorize** — Workers AI + Vectorize don't run in the sandbox. A deterministic
  bag-of-words embedding + in-memory cosine index stand in. It proves the recall PATH (index → search
  → drop hidden/expired), not real semantic quality. `WorkersAiEmbeddingProvider` is the production swap-in.
- **D1 / R2 / Queues / Durable Object storage** — not run in the sandbox. Logic is tested against
  in-memory repositories that mirror `migrations/0001_init.sql`. **Known limit:** the DO keeps state
  for its lifetime but is not yet persisted across evictions; a D1/DO-storage adapter is the next
  plumbing step (Phase 7 territory, noted here so it isn't mistaken for done).
- **Telegram / Twilio** — no real credentials. `TelegramChannel` is real code but unrun; the
  `FakeOwnerChannel` is used in tests and can simulate a failed send.

## Honesty audit (against the brief's mandatory rules)

- No fake success: the five actions return `not_connected`; nothing logs "Executed"/dispatched:true.
- Fail closed: webhook refuses with no secret; owner refuses with no OWNER_CHAT_ID; model throws with no key.
- Code never reads Sid's words to decide: no `if text == "YES"`; confirmations are code-validated only.
- No silent drops: empty reply, model error, and failed send are each logged + surfaced.
- No keyword fallback pretending to be the model: MissingModelKeyError, said plainly.
- Tool-count: the full catalogue is sent to the model; there is no cap below the real tool count.

## Not yet built (be honest with Sid)

All seven phases' feature code is built and tested. What remains is deploy-side wiring, not new features:
- D1/DO/Vectorize/R2 production persistence adapters (in-memory / fake stand-ins today). Repos are
  written against `migrations/0001_init.sql`'s shape, so this is adapter work, not a redesign.
- Durable Object state persisted across evictions (today the DO keeps state only for its lifetime).
- The DO WebSocket loop that streams ConversationRelay call turns (the `/voice` webhook + all voice
  logic exist and are tested; this is the transport that carries a voice turn into the same agent core).
- The five action tools are wired to NO real provider on purpose — each returns `not_connected`.
