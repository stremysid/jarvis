/**

 * Config that, when missing, must make Jarvis FAIL CLOSED rather than guess:
 *  - OWNER_CHAT_ID:  without it, nobody is the owner. We never treat everyone as Sid.
 *  - TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET: without it, every webhook is refused.
 *  - OWNER_ACTION_PIN: without it, ordinary calls still work but every one of the
 *    five confirmed actions on a call refuses. That is the safe direction.
 *  - DEEPSEEK_API_KEY: without it, there is no model. We say so plainly; we never
 *    fall back to a keyword bot pretending to be the model.
