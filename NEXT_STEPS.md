# Next steps

The milestone order is in [the roadmap](docs/plan/2026-09-03-jarvis-roadmap.md).
R0 only; do not start R1 or resume superseded implementation plans.

## R0 checkpoint, 2026-09-11

1. **PR #5 at edac272 reviewed: no merge blocker.** Seven CI jobs observed
   green, Hermes 108/108. See [the review](docs/reviews/r0-pr5-edac272.md).
   Runtime alias rejection, locking, share flags and interpreter pin remain
   intact. The manual extended suites remain unrun.
2. **Credential rotation done by owner confirmation.** Do not repeat the
   three-pepper/DeepSeek rotation or ask for values.
3. **Config cleanup implemented in PR #5.** Exact four-name required lists;
   legacy generators retired. Leave the stored `PIN_VERIFIER_JSON` secret
   until after item 5, then use separate owner-confirmed deletion.
4. **Deployment scripts implemented in PR #5.** Dry-run by default, explicit
   production environment selection, publishing confirmation. See
   [the runbook](docs/runbooks/deploy.md).
5. **Item 5 is done.** PR #5 and PR #6 are merged; `main` is green at
   `ffa3ecd`. Migrations `0008`-`0013` were applied 2026-09-11 04:39 UTC and
   verified against `d1_migrations`. Both Workers are published from the
   reviewed commit, the gateway with all four cron triggers and the watchdog
   with its own five-minute trigger. Gateway `/health` answers 200 in
   production; it answered 501 before.
6. **Items 6 and 7 are deployed.** Health is routed, the hourly job archives,
   and the watchdog's must-report list defaults to `cloud-gateway`. Its
   heartbeat secret is set on both Workers and it alerts through its own
   Telegram bot.
7. **STILL OWNER-BLOCKED: the external monitor.** Follow the numbered
   UptimeRobot actions in [the runbook](docs/runbooks/deploy.md), against the
   watchdog's `/health` and never the gateway's. Until that is observed,
   nothing watches the watchdog.
8. **R0 exit is incomplete.** Telegram `/status` and `/queue`, gateway cron
   heartbeat delivery recorded by the watchdog, and the morning digest
   saying "nothing due" remain unverified. Read-only D1 checks at 05:11 UTC
   found successful drain/poll runs and a fresh watchdog self-row, but no
   gateway heartbeat row. Green CI on current main `2b506c8` is verified.
   Do not start R1 until the remaining evidence is observed.

## Next gate

[PR #6](https://github.com/ksid1229-ops/jarvis/pull/6) passed Claude Opus 5
high review and is merged; PR #7 is also merged. No code-review or initial
deployment hold remains. Continue live acceptance, not another wiring pass.
Do not repeat migrations or clear the must-report list to silence the
unresolved gateway alert. At 05:15:20 UTC the real gateway heartbeat POST
returned `rejected: status 404`; an external unauthenticated POST to the
public `/heartbeat` endpoint returned 401. A shared-secret mismatch is not
established. Sid must verify the configured URL first; the runbook separates
that check from Worker-to-Worker routing and authentication diagnosis.

**Remaining evidence:** Telegram `/status` and `/queue`, gateway heartbeat
receipt after a real cron, and the scheduled morning digest saying "nothing
due". The current default schedule is 07:30 America/Toronto, September 11
at 11:30 UTC. External UptimeRobot monitoring also remains owner-blocked.
No release is declared. Sid authorizes roadmap building without approvals
between items, but production, secrets, merging and consequential actions
remain his. After R0 passes, R1 requires Claude Opus 5 **max** review under
BUILDING.md; the cross-vendor gate and stop rules remain in force.

## Built and unwired

These have code and tests and nothing calls them yet.

- **Google Classroom ingestion.** `classroom-client.ts` and
  `deadline-ingestion.ts` exist; the hourly poll job does not call them,
  because no deployment holds the Google OAuth credentials. Until it does,
  `deadline_sources` has nothing writing to it and the deadline half of the
  digest is empty rather than stale.
- **The Brightspace scrape.** Deliberately not built. It needs a real browser
  session and belongs in the local agent. `RawDeadlineItem` is the interface
  it feeds.
- **Deadline status.** Nothing sets `submitted`, `missed` or `cancelled`. The
  grade and missing-work watch is what closes this.
- **Decision expiry.** `listOpenQueue` filters lapsed items out of the queue,
  and nothing moves their status to `expired`. The drain job should sweep
  them.
- **`project()` in the vault.** The write path has no authority gate in front
  of it. See KNOWN_ISSUES.

## The release gate

**Live calling is R1 and v1.0.** The roadmap records that Sid already owns
the Twilio number and credentials. No live calling evidence exists yet.

## The two-stage Obsidian adapter

Stage one is built -- see DECISIONS.md. The roadmap assigns completion of
the adapter on the home node to R2 and defers the native bridge. Do not
resume the old bridge plan as part of R0.

**The redactor comes first.** Vault observations are stored verbatim with no
redaction, so building the cloud upload path before the redactor would ship
Sid's notes to the gateway unredacted. It is a prerequisite for O2/O3/O4, not
a follow-up.

## Hermes H1

The roadmap supersedes the remaining runtime service work with R3. Keep
the pinning mechanism and do not resume Tasks 10-13 in R0.

## Smaller, worth doing

- Clear the 122 baseline test-type errors `pnpm --filter @jarvis/cloud-gateway
  typecheck:tests` reports, then make it a CI gate.
- Move the Telegram rate limiter and the provider circuit breaker into a
  Durable Object. Both are per-isolate today.
- Complete the owner-blocked external monitor action above after deployment.
- A process bootstrap for the local agent: there is no `jarvis service`
  command and no Windows service host, so the run loop cannot be started.
